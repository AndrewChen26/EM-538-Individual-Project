 Amazon employee card access

To test this algorithm, please copy and paste the test csv file into the same folder as the code. Then modify the testing code to include the name of the test csv file.

Project Objective:
Predict the Amazon employee's card access using historical data.

Scoring Criteria:
We use the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) score as our primary scoring method because avoiding false positives is our top priority. Granting access to unauthorized individuals poses a greater risk than mistakenly denying access to the right people.

Method:
We decide to use the random forest model.

Result:
We achieved a 94% accuracy score, an 82.7 NPV score!
